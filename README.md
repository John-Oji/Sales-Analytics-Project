### Project Overview

This data analysis project focuses on delivering valuable insights into the sales performance of an international agribusiness processing and trading company over the past year. By thoroughly analyzing the sales data, we aim to uncover key trends, provide data-driven recommendations, and deepen our understanding of the company's performance. Our objective is to support strategic decision-making and drive business growth through detailed and actionable insights.

### Data Source
Sales Data: The primary dataset utilized for this analysis is the "sales_data.xlsx" file, which contains comprehensive details on each sale made by the company, categorized by region and salesperson.

### Tools

- **Excel** : Power Query - for data cleaning
        , Pivot Table - for data Analysis
        , Pivot Chart - for data visualization.

### Data Preparation

  In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing value
  3. Date cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

  EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
 - What is the overall sales trend?
 - What is the sales by salesperson?
 - What is the sales count by invoice amount?
 - What is the sales by region?
 - Who are the top five customers?

### Data Analysis
 No code was used in this project. The three main Excel tools used for analysis are:
    
  1. **Power Query** -Clean and preprocess data. - Merge data from different tables and sources. - Perform complex transformations without manual intervention.
  2. **Pivot Table** -Used to aggregate data by categories (e.g., regions, salespersons).  - Used to create summaries such as totals, averages and counts.
  3. **Pivotchart**  -Used to create dynamic and interactive charts.  -Used to visualize trends, patterns, and comparisons.  - Update automatically with changes in the PivotTable data.

### Results

The analysis results are summerized as follows:

1. The sales trend shows significant fluctuations throughout the year.
   
2. There is a noticeable spike in sales during June and December, indicating potential seasonal trends or successful campaigns during these months.
   
3. There is a significant disparity between the highest and lowest sales performers.
   
4. There is regional variations in sales performance, the North region leads with $141,660 in sales, followed by the East region with $108,276 while the West and South regions have relatively lower sales at $91,252 and $93,848 respectively.
   
5. Company D is the top customer with purchases amounting to $67,181.
    
6. The majority of sales invoices (218) fall in the range of 0-1000,there are fewer invoices as the amount range increases, with the least number of invoices (11) in the >4000 range,this suggests a higher frequency of lower-value transactions.

### Recommendation
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

- Analyze the reasons behind the peak sales in June and December and replicate successful tactics in other months.

- Investigate the high frequency of low-value transactions and identify opportunities to shift some of these to higher-value ranges.

- Focus on retaining top customers like Company D and H through loyalty programs and personalized offers.
  
- Implement targeted strategies to boost sales in the West and South regions.
  
- Provide additional training and support to underperforming salespersons like Jan Kotas.

### Limitations
I noticed that the analysis is limited to the year 2014. Trends and recommendations might not apply to other years. Additional data from previous and subsequent years could provide a more comprehensive understanding of sales trends. The analysis does not include detailed customer segmentation (e.g., industry, size, buying patterns) understanding different customer segments could lead to more targeted and effective sales strategies.
